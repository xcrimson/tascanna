# Tascanna app (beta)

Shows masterful wielding of:

- **RxJava** so app stays responsive during IO operations
- **RxAndroid** to connect RxJava with Android OS
- **RxBinding** to connect Android UI with RxJava
- **Retrofit** to work with REST API
- **RecyclerView** to efficiently display lists
- **Glide** to display the beautiful picture of Sven
- **Stateless4j** because UI's are all about FSM's
